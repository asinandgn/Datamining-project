# Datamining-project

I am excited to share my project, Introduction to Data Mining: Customer Personality Analysis, as an example of my skills in data analytics and machine learning. Using Python and Jupyter Hub, I worked with a Kaggle dataset to uncover customer insights through techniques like data cleaning, feature engineering, and clustering. We implemented KNN and K-Means algorithms to classify and analyze customer segments effectively.

This project reflects my passion for leveraging data to solve complex problems and drive decision-making. I look forward to applying these skills to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.
